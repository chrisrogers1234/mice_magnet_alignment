Scripts to do the transfer matrix analysis

Executable scripts:
===================
* calculate_tm.py which will calculate transfer matrices for data
* do_geometry.bash which will download a geometry for a  given run number
* fit_tm.py which will attempt to fit calculated tranfer matrices (calculated by calculate_tm.py) to analytical model, by wiggling the magnets

Meat:
=====
All the meat is in scripts directory. Here you will find
* a bunch of configuration files.
* data_loader.py Loads data from disk into memory; applies a bunch of "data quality cuts"
* data_plotter.py Plots raw data
* pz_calculator.py Toy pz fitter, for straight track data
* tm_calculator.py Calculate  the transfer matrix
* tm_plotter.py Plot the calculated transfer matrix, along with fitted values
* lattice.py Analytical transfer matrix calculation
* fit_transfer_matrix directory contains routines to fit the transfer matrix; there is another routine to calculate  the analytical transfer matrix in here. Sorry.
* make_field_map.py Utility for plotting fields
* geometry_toy.py can probably be ignored
